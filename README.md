## Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic introduced a severe structural shock on the global film ecosystem, accelerating the shift towards digital platformization. This project1 aims to quantify the persistence and interaction of these changes using data extracted from TMDb and IMDb across three temporal regimes: Pre-COVID (2017-2019), COVID- Shock (2020-2021), and Post-COVID Adjustment (2022-2024). We trained an XGBoost classifier to test the predictive power of our dataset and conducted statistical tests to quantify this shift from both industrial and viewer experience perspectives. As a result we identified features such as runtime and budget as primary indicators as well as further emphasizing the divergence between theatrical and streaming releases.

## Contribution Statement
Ahmet Alperen Güngör performed data sanity checks, data analysis and produced visualizations for release strategies and feature impacts. Arda Gürsul created the dataset, performed preprocessing and model creation, and produced visualizations of financial data. Hagen Carstensen analysed changes to genre composition and created the accompanying plot. All authors jointly wrote the text of the report.

NARRATIVE: RELEASE STRATEGY ACROSS PRE / COVID / POST ERAS

Hypothesis
The film industry experienced a structural shift during COVID that affected
theatrical and streaming releases differently, with distinct dynamics across
the pre-COVID (2017–2019), COVID-shock (2020–2021), and post-COVID (2022–2024)
periods.

Approach
We compare temporal eras within each release strategy (not theatrical vs
streaming directly). For each metric, we use bootstrap confidence intervals,
permutation tests, DKW bands, and Cohen’s d. Monthly time-series charts provide
trend context with period shading. A p-value table summarizes significance
across era comparisons.

Key Findings

1) Runtime
- Theatrical runtimes drop during COVID and rebound strongly post-COVID.
  Pre vs COVID and COVID vs Post are both significant with small-to-moderate
  effect sizes.
- Streaming runtimes shift slightly during COVID and then stabilize; pre vs
  post is not significant. This suggests a stronger COVID-era disruption in
  theatrical runtimes than in streaming.

2) Budget
- Theatrical budgets dip during COVID and rise in post-COVID, but the pre vs
  post difference is not significant. The major movement is the COVID shock
  and partial recovery.
- Streaming budgets surge during COVID and then fall post-COVID, with both
  COVID-era transitions significant. This is one of the clearest COVID-era
  shifts for streaming.

3) Revenue
- Theatrical revenue declines in COVID, with a significant pre vs COVID drop,
  and remains below pre-COVID in post-COVID (pre vs post is significant).
- Streaming revenue shows weaker era shifts; only COVID vs post is significant.
  This implies box office revenues are more sensitive to era effects.

4) Popularity
- Theatrical popularity dips during COVID and rises sharply post-COVID; all
  era comparisons are significant.
- Streaming popularity steadily increases across periods; all comparisons are
  significant but effect sizes are smaller than theatrical.

5) Audience Engagement (vote_count)
- Theatrical engagement collapses during COVID and remains lower post-COVID;
  pre vs COVID and pre vs post are significant.
- Streaming engagement rises in COVID then drops post-COVID; all era
  comparisons are significant, suggesting a strong pandemic-driven attention
  spike for streaming.

Overall Interpretation
Theatrical releases experienced a clear COVID shock with partial post-COVID
recovery, especially in runtime, popularity, and engagement. Streaming shows a
different pattern: budget and engagement spike during COVID, while post-COVID
levels often revert downward. This supports the hypothesis of a pandemic-era
reallocation of resources and attention toward streaming, followed by a post-
COVID normalization.

Genre Context
The genre period trends (two-panel line chart) show that the mix of genres in
theatrical and streaming releases changes across eras, but the directions are
not uniform across strategies. This suggests that strategy-specific genre
composition is part of how studios adapted during COVID.

Conclusion
Across pre / COVID / post eras, both strategies change, but the COVID shock is
stronger and more consistent in theatrical outcomes (runtime, popularity,
engagement) while streaming shows sharper shifts in budget and engagement.
These temporal patterns align with the hypothesis that COVID accelerated the
role of streaming while disrupting theatrical release dynamics, with partial
but uneven recovery in the post-COVID era.
